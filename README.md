# A/B Test Results


A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, I work to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website, with data provided by Udacity. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Requirements
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
