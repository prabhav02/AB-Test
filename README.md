# A/B Test Results
This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, I work to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website, with data provided by Udacity. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Requirements
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels

## Installation
To get the Jupyter Notebook running, execute the following in the command line and select `ab-test.ipynb` from the Jupyter Notebook dashboard. The conda environment setup is optional; I have provided the base environment in `base.yaml`.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/evanchen13/ab-test.git
$ cd ab-test
$ conda env create -f base.yaml
$ jupyter notebook
```
